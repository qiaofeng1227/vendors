## 怎么联系？

通过官方邮箱`info@odoo.com`转到接口人`cco@odoo.com`  

## 联系结果

对方未正面回答是否允许使用，但提醒我们宣传产品的方式要明确，不能让用户误认为我们是或者代表官方，以及怀疑所用的产品是否是Odoo的（需要明确对软件的任何修改，以及不是企业版）  

以下是对方回复的原文：  
```

Thank you for your email. It has to be clear, at all time and not matter the platform or communication support, that you are not Odoo S.A or acting on its behalf. The logo and trademark can only be used to describe the product (mentioning any changes that Websoft9 Inc. has implemented and that it's not the Enterprise version) or the fact that it was initially developed by Odoo S.A. but nothing else. Please be very clear in the way you promote the product, the customer should not wonder if they're dealing with Odoo S.A. or not, with our own product or not.

I hope this clarifies the situation. Should you have questions, please let me know.
