## 怎么联系？

先联系官方法务：trademar_us@oracle.com，后联系到法务接口人 `johanna.sistek@oracle.com`

## 联系结果

对方同意，可以基于 “×× for MySQL” 来使用MySQL，具体如下：

```
Thank you for taking to read our guidelines for how to refer to our products.  You are correct, you can use the format "for MySQL," so a name like "Websoft VM Image for MySQL on Amazon Linux" would be consistent with our guidelines. 

In addition, you may refer to "MySQL" in standard font in your product description, and you do not require a formal permission to use it in that manner. We would want you to avoid referring to it in any manner that implies that MySQL is a product from Websoft9.  
```
